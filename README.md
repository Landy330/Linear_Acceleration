# Linear_Acceleration
not finished yet

It's an Android App using the Linear Acceleration senor to records the acceleration.

Now it shows the x,y,z three directions data but these data can not be saved.

The left button "start" switches two statuses called "start" and "stop" of the sensor. 
The status "start" means the sensor is working, while the status "stop" means it is stop, and all of the data is 0. 

The right button "stop" swiches two statuse called "going on" and "pause". 
"Pause" means "the sensor is working but the app is not updating data now", so you can see no change of the data. 
"Going on" status means "the sensor continues to update data".

The app is not finished yet. 
Later on, we will record the updated data and then use GPS and Baidu Map(or Gaode Map) to draw the path of user.
